This directory contains a few example MzScheme extensions. Most are
implemented directly in C. A few that are listed at the end use the
mzc `c-lambda', etc. forms.

 * hello.c - returns the string "Hello, World!". Demonstrates creating
   a Scheme value.

 * fmod.c - defines the `fmod' procedure, which calculates modulo on
   floating-point numbers. Demonstrates creating Scheme procedures
   from C and adding top-level definitions.

 * curses.c - links MzScheme to the curses library. Demonstrates more
   procedures and definitions, a little more type dispatching, and
   returning multiple values.

 * makeadder.c - defines `make-adder', which takes a number and
   returns a procedure that takes another number to add to
   it. Demonstrates closure creation in C, getting Scheme global
   values, and calling Scheme procedures from C.

 * catch.c - defined `eval-string/catch-error', which catches
   excpetions whil evaluating a string. Demonstrates how to catch
   exceptions from C code.

 * bitmatrix.c - implements two-dimentional bit matrixes with some
   operations. Demonstrates defining a new Scheme data type, data
   allocation, fancy integer type checking, general exception raising,
   and registering static variables.

 * helloprint.c - prints "Hello, World!" directly to the current
   output port rather than relying on the read-eval-print-loop.
   Demonstrates using built-in Scheme parameter values from C.

 * tree.cxx - shows how to inject a C++ class into MzScheme's class
   world.


 * fmod-ez.c - same as fmod.c, but implemented with `c-lambda'.

 * msgbox.ss - a Windows-only example, provides a `message-box'
   procedure.
